    "    -  (Hint: this is probably the easiest one)\n",
    "1. Find a better network architecture. Some ideas:\n",
    "    - Look at the various options in https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/nn.html#torch.nn.GRU\n",
    "    - You can make the network wider or deeper.\n",
    "    - You can try to learn separate encoders and decoders.\n",
    "1. Use an LSTM instead of a GRU.\n",
    "    - https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/nn.html#torch.nn.LSTM\n",
    "    - The output of an LSTM is a hidden state **and** a cell state, so you will need to deal with a tuple instead of a single vector.\n",
    "1. Use a Transformer instead of a GRU.\n",
    "    - https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/nn.html#torch.nn.Transformer\n",
    "    - Be sure to get the masks right so you don't condition on the future characters: https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/nn.html#torch.nn.Transformer.generate_square_subsequent_mask may be of use.\n",
    "1. Train a model using student-forcing.\n",
    "    - You will have to modify the network inputs.\n",
    "    - You will need to use `torch.nn.GRUCell` and its like. https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/nn.html#grucell\n",
    "    - You cannot simply feed an empty string to start off a sequence. The sequence must be somehow conditioned on prior ground truth.\n",
    "1. Train a model on words instead of characters.\n",
    "    - You will need to redefine your input/output space vocabulary as well.\n",
    "    - You should replace any words that occur less than 5 times in the dataset with an <unknown\\> token. \n",
    "1. Write a new data loader which picks a random point in the text to start from and returns 10 consecutive sequences starting from that point onward. \n",
    "    - You should also modify the train and test functions to reset the memory when you reset the sequence.\n",
    "    - You should consider an epoch to be feeding in approximately the number of characters in the dataset.\n",
    "    - You may run into issues if your dataset size/epochs are not a multiple of your batch size.\n",
    "1. Train on sentences instead of one long sequence.\n",
    "    - You should still produce output character by character.\n",
    "    - Sentences can end with a . ! ?, but words like Mr. generally do not end a sentence.\n",
    "    - A sentence may also continue in the case of quotations. For example: ``\"Do your homework!\" said the TAs.`` is only one sentence.\n",
    "    - Your parsing does not have to be perfect, but try to incorporate as many of these rules as you can.\n",
    "    - Feel free to use existing NLP tools for finding sentence endings. One is spacy: https://spacy.io/usage/linguistic-features#section-sbd\n",
    "    - All sentences should end with an <eos\\> token. Your output sampling should now stop when it produces the <eos\\> token.\n",

    "1. Just like last time, provide plots for training error, test error, and test accuracy. Also provide a plot of your train and test perplexity per epoch.\n",
    "    - In class we defined perplexity as `2^(p*log_2(q))`, However the PyTorch cross entropy function uses the natural log. To compute perplexity directly from the cross entropy, you should use `e^p*ln(q)`.\n",
    "    - We encourage you to try multiple network modifications and hyperparameters, but you only need to provide plots for your best model. Please list the modifications and hyperparameters.    \n",
    "    \n",
    "2. What was your final test accuracy? What was your final test perplexity?\n",
    "3. What was your favorite sentence generated via each of the sampling methods? What was the prompt you gave to generate that sentence?\n",
    "4. Which sampling method seemed to generate the best results? Why do you think that is?\n",
    "5. For sampling and beam search, try multiple temperatures between 0 and 2. \n",
    "    - Which produces the best outputs? Best as in made the most sense, your favorite, or funniest, doesn't really matter how you decide.\n",
    "    - What does a temperature of 0 do? What does a temperature of 0<temp<1 do? What does a temperature of 1 do? What does a temperature of above 1 do? What would a negative temperature do (assuming the code allowed for negative temperature)?\n",
