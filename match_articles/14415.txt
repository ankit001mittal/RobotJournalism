Liverpool overcome Middlesbrough 3-0 at Anfield.
Georginio Wijnaldum’s 45th-minute strike set the Reds on their way before Philippe Coutinho and Adam Lallana made it an Anfield celebration with second-half goals.
Wijnaldum superbly controlled Roberto Firmino’s quick pass to fire emphatically past Brad Guzan and give his side an all-important lead.
Six minutes after the restart Coutinho curled a trademark free-kick in from 20 yards out and on 56 minutes the match was over as Lallana raced on to Wijnaldum’s nod-down to fire Liverpool's third goal.
