Everton were made to work hard to see off the challenge of a determined Burnley at Goodison Park.
After a goalless first half in which the visitors enjoyed the best chances, Phil Jagielka put the hosts in front four minutes after the break.
But goalkeeper soon fouled Sam Vokes in the penalty area, and the Burnley striker made it 1-1 from the spot.
Ross Barkleyâ€™s shot was deflected in for an own-goal by Ben Mee with 19 minutes left - and Romelu Lukaku made the points safe three minutes later.
