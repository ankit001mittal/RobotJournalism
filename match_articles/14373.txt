Diego Costa scored couple of goals as Chelsea earned a 4-2 victory over Southampton.
The Spaniard netted twice in the second half, outs-muscling the defender to head in from Cesc Fabregas's cross. Chelsea went 1-0 up after five minutes when Hazard superbly found the bottom corner, before Saints' bright response was rewarded with Oriol Romeu equalising from close range.
Gary Cahill bravely headed in from Marcos Alonso's knockdown in first-half stoppage time, before Costa's double and a late headed consolation for Southampton's Ryan Bertrand.
