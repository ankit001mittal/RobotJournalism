A rare Vincent Kompany goal plus strikes from Leroy Sane and Sergio Aguero boosted Manchester City with a 3-0 win at Southampton.
After a goalless first half at St Mary’s Stadium, Pep Guardiola saw Kompany head in his goal from David Silva’s corner.
City doubled their lead with 13 minutes remaining when they broke and Kevin De Bruyne passed to Sane to score easily.
Less than three minutes later it was 3-0, De Bruyne crossing for Aguero to head in.
