Second-half goals from Lazar Markovic and Sam Clucas gave 10-man Hull City three important points as they beat Watford 2-0 at the KCOM Stadium.
There was little to separate the two sides in the opening 45 minutes, but Hull City player Oumar Niasse was shown a red card.
After the break, Hull took the lead thanks to Markovic. Ten minutes later, Watford cleared a corner as far as Clucas, who chested it down and unleashed a stunning volley into the top corner from 30 yards.
