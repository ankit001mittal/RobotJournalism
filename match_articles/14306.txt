Two goals from Harry Kane helped Tottenham Hotspur claim a 3-2 victory over Everton. Spurs controlled the first half at White Hart Lane and Kane put his side ahead on 20 minutes with a thumping strike.
He doubled the lead on 56 minutes, firing his goal after Everton's defence were dispossessed.
Everton were given a lifeline when Romelu Lukaku pulled a goal back with 10 minutes left.
Dele Alli seemed to seal the win when he prodded home a clever Harry Winks free-kick in stoppage time but, a minute later, Enner Valencia added an Everton second from a Ross Barkley set-piece.
