Mesut Ozil, Theo Walcott and Olivier Giroud scored in the second half to give Arsenal a 3-0 win over West Ham United.
Ozil opened the scoring on 58 minutes when his left-foot shot deceived Hammers goalkeeper.
Ten minutes later Ozil pulled the ball back for Walcott to finish neatly, before Giroud curled in a superb third from the right edge of the area after a burst upfield from fellow team mate Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain.
