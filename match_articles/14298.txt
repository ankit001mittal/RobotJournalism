Andre Ayew claimed a second-half equaliser to give West Ham United a deserved draw at Vicarage Road.
The striker prodded home on 73 minutes. Watford had taken the lead with Troy Deeney's third-minute penalty but the visitors had the better of the chances thereafter. The Hammers held on for a point after playing the final four minutes with 10 men after Antonio was sent off.
