Shkodran Mustafi's goal denied Manchester City a chance to win as Arsenal earned a 2-2 draw at Emirates Stadium.
Shkodran Mustafi glanced Mesut Ozil's corner past the goalkeeper. The match got off to a blistering start, with Leroy Sane latching on to Kevin De Bruyne's through ball, rounding the goalkeeper and slotting in Man City's opener on five minutes. Theo Walcott levelled following Mustafi's header into the penalty area on 40 minutes, before Sergio Aguero's drilled effort from a tight angle put City back in front before half-time.
After the break, Arsenal capitalised with Mustafi's leveller.
