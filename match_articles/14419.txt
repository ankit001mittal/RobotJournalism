Manchester City finish with a 5-0 win at Watford.
Pep Guardiola's side started with a blitz of first-half goals.
Vincent Kompany headed the opener before Sergio Aguero struck twice from assists by Kevin De Bruyne and Leroy Sane. 
Fernandinho's poked effort made it it 4-0 at the break and Gabriel Jesus got in on the act in the 58th minute, converting Aguero's cross to complete a dominant display.
