A superb goal from Robbie Brady for Burnley gave the Clarets a 1-1 draw against Chelsea.
The visitors had the perfect start to the contest, with Pedro collecting a Victor Moses centre and slotting the ball past the goalkeeper in the seventh minute.
But Burnley drew level on 24 minutes as Brady's left-footed free-kick found the top corner.
