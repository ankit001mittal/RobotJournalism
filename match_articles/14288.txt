Swansea City beat Leicester City 2-0 at the Liberty Stadium.
After a closely contested opening half an hour, central defender Alfie Mawson’s sweetly-struck volley from Federico Fernandez’s cushioned header put Swansea in front on 36 minutes.
January signing Martin Olsson, a left-back, fired the ball through the legs of the goalkeeper after a wonderful pass from Gylfi Sigurdsson in first-half stoppage time.
