Christian Benteke scored twice against Liverpool to give Crystal Palace a victory. Liverpool started well and Philippe Coutinho put them ahead on 24 minutes with a curling goal. Palace got back into the contest just before half-time when Benteke converted a Yohan Cabaye cross.
Liverpool piled on the pressure after the break but Palace claimed the winner, Benteke heading in after Jason Puncheon's flick from a corner.
