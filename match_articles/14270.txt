Eden Hazard scored a stunning goal as Chelsea hit Arsenal with a comfortable 3-1 win at Stamford Bridge.
After an open start, Antonio Conte’s team took control from 13 minutes when Marcos Alonso followed up after Diego Costa’s header hit the bar and put Chelsea on the front foot.
Hazard doubled Chelsea’s lead on 53 minutes with a mazy run from his own half that left Arsenal’s defence in confusion.
Cesc Fabregas came on to add a third on 85 minutes, capitalising on the goalkeeper’s poor pass, while Olivier Giroud got a late consolation for Arsenal.
