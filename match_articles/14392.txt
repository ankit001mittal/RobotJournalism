Sam Vokes scored twice as Burnley came from behind to claim a point against West Bromwich Albion at Turf Moor. After a goalless first half, Ashley Barnes picked himself up after being brought down in the area and crossed for Vokes to give Burnley the lead.
West Brom responded well and were level on 66 minutes, when Salomon Rondon fired in the first goal. Tony Pulisâ€™ side went ahead 12 minutes later when Craig Dawson headed in a Chris Brunt corner. But Vokes levelled the scores, flicking Robbie Brady's free-kick over the advancing goalkeeper.
