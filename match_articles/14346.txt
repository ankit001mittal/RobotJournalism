Watford won the home league match against West Bromwich Albion. The hosts capitalised on a promising start when Troy Deeney’s deft header fell to fellow forward M’Baye Niang, who took a touch on the edge of the area before arrowing a spectacular strike into the top corner.
Just after half-time Deeney, outmuscled two West Brom defenders to finish from close range.
