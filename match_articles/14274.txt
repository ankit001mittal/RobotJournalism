Manchester United extended their league tally by 3 more points thanks to a convincing victory over champions Leicester City at the King Power Stadium.
The two sides were evenly matched in the opening exchanges but United started to gain control and they took the lead with a fine breakaway goal from Henrikh Mkhitaryan on 42 minutes.
The visitors doubled their lead two minutes later when Zlatan Ibrahimovic swept the ball home. And United's victory was sealed four minutes after the break through Juan Mata, who finished after a smart passing move.
