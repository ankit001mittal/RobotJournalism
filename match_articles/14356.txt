Manchester United boosted by beating 10-man Sunderland 3-0 at the Stadium of Light.
Zlatan Ibrahimovic set them on their way with a superb curling finish from Ander Herrera's pass.
A foul on Herrera resulted in a red card for Sunderland's Sebastian Larsson shortly before half-time.
Man Utd went 2-0 up quickly after the break, with Henrikh Mkhitaryan slotting in after a fine team move, before Ibrahimovic teed up Marcus Rashford to fire in a late third.
