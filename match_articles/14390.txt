Two Arsenal goals in quick succession gave Arsenal a deserving victory over Manchester United in the Premier League.
A goalless first half had a number of chances, but the match came to life nine minutes after half-time.
Granit Xhaka’s shot deflected off over De Gea. Three minutes later Arsenal were 2-0 up, Danny Welbeck heading in Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain’s cross.
