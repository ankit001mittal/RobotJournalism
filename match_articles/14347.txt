Two goals from Eden Hazard kept Chelsea on course as they beat Manchester City 2-1 at Stamford Bridge.
Hazard opened the scoring when he converted Cesar Azpilicueta's 10th-minute cutback, before Sergio Aguero levelled for City after the goalkeeper parried David Silva's shot into his path.
Hazard later restored Chelsea's lead by scoring the rebound after his 35th-minute penalty had been saved by the goalkeeper.
