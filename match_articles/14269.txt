Peter Crouch scored his league goal as Stoke City extended their points tally with a point with a 1-1 draw at home to Everton.
Crouch slid in to steer home Marko Arnautovic's centre with only seven minutes gone. Everton goalkeeper did well to deny Stoke City to extend their lead before the Everton equalised six minutes before half-time when Seamus Coleman's cross was diverted into the net by defender Ryan Shawcross.
The home side searched for a winner in the second half but both the sides played out a draw.
