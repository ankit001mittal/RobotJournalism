A last-gasp penalty from Zlatan Ibrahimovic rescued a point for Manchester United against Everton.
The visitors took the lead from a corner, Ashley Williamsâ€™ flick-on turned in by Phil Jagielka with his back to goal. As Manchester Utd searched for an equaliser, Everton held on until four minutes into stoppage time when Williams handled in the area, earning himself a red card, and Ibrahimovic converted his penalty.
