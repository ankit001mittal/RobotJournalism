Sergio Aguero's goal helped Manchester City as they fought back to earn a pulsating 1-1 draw at the Etihad Stadium.
After a goalless first-half finished with a flurry of chances, Liverpool went ahead when James Milner coolly scored a penalty. But Aguero converted Kevin De Bruyne's brilliant centre on 68 minutes.
