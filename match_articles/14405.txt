Arsenal kept their nerves with a 4-1 win at Stoke City.
The visiting side dominated the first half at the bet365 Stadium and took the lead just before the break when Hector Bellerin crossed for Olivier Giroud to tap in.
Ten minutes after the break, Mesut Ozil, on his first start at Stoke, doubled the lead from Alexis Sanchez’s sublime through-ball.
This prompted Stoke to bring on Peter Crouch and the striker halved the deficit by turning in Marko Arnautovic’s cross.
But Sanchez, in his final contribution before coming off with an injury, restored the two-goal lead with a precise shot. Aaron Ramsey then set up Giroud for a fourth.
