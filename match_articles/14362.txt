Manchester United completed Premier League win over Chelsea with a commanding display at Old Trafford.
Goals in either half by Marcus Rashford and Ander Herrera rewarded Man Utd’s high-pressing performance. Rashford set the tone by racing on to Herrera’s through-ball to clip coolly past the goalkeeper on seven minutes. Herrera doubled United’s lead on 49 minutes when his shot deflected off the defender.
