Alexis Sanchez and Olivier Giroud scored the goals as Arsenal earned their victory at Southampton.
Arsenal took the lead on the hour mark, Mesut Ozil playing in Sanchez, who took two players out of the game with a sublime turn before claiming his goal.
Giroud doubled Arsenal's lead seven minutes from time with a close-range header as Aaron Ramsey headed Sanchez's cross back across goal.
