Crystal Palace won the match against Chelsea. Cesc Fabregas flicked in Eden Hazard's cross to give Chelsea a fifth-minute lead, but the visitor side rallied and struck twice in as many minutes. Wilfried Zaha's shot from just inside the box levelled before Christian Benteke dinked in his goal in the 11th minute.
Chelsea pushed in a bid to avoid a home defeat but could not beat the goalkeeper, who had a superb match.
