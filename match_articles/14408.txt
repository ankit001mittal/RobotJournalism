A late goal by Michy Batshuayi ensured Chelsea 1-0 win over West Bromwich Albion.
Chelsea's evening appeared destined for frustration as they could not convert domination into goals against dogged opponents but Batshuayiâ€™s 82nd-minute strike ended the resistance.
With eight minutes left Cesar Azpilicueta kept a wayward shot alive and picked out Batshuayi for the goal.
