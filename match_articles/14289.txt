Gareth McAuley scored deep into stoppage time to seal a point for West Bromwich Albion at West Ham United.
West Brom took a sixth-minute lead through Nacer Chadli. West Ham equalised in the second half when Manuel Lanziniâ€™s shot was pushed on to the bar, only for Sofiane Feghouli to tap in the rebound.
West Bromwich's Goalkeeper denied West Ham a second, but could not keep out another Lanzini long shot with four minutes left.
But West Brom denied the home side victory when Chris Brunt's corner was headed goalwards by Jonny Evans, whose header came off McAuley before going in.
