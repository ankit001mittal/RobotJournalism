M'Baye Niang inspired Watford to a 2-1 victory over 10-man Burnley. The forward assisted Troy Deeney's goal as Watford took an early lead. 
The goal came after Jeff Hendrick was sent off for a foul.
Burnley's task got tougher when Niang headed in his goal before half-time. Burnley pulled one back through Ashley Barnes' penalty but it was too little too late.
