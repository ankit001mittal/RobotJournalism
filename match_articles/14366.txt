Sunderland Fabio Borini hit a late equaliser to earn his side a point as they drew 2-2 with West Ham United.
Borini drove home from the edge of the area past West Ham goalkeeper. Andre Ayew had given West Ham a fifth-minute lead after Andy Carroll had knocked back Robert Snodgrass’s cross.
In blustery conditions, Sunderland equalised with their first goal for 701 minutes when Wahbi Khazri’s left-wing corner went straight in.
James Collins restored West Ham’s lead immediately after half-time, heading in a Snodgrass corner.
After Borini's goal, Sam Byram was sent off for West Ham.
