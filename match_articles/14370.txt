Arsenal won the match thanks to a double against Sunderland by Alexis Sanchez.
The Gunners were frustrated by Jordan Pickford's excellence until Sanchez capitalised with two goals in 10 second-half minutes.
Sanchez tapped in Mesut Ozil’s cutback on 72 minutes. The Chilean then headed in Giroud’s hooked effort.
