Romelu Lukaku scored four goals as Everton completed a nine-goal victory over AFC Bournemouth.
AFC Bournemouth were hoping for a good start but were behind after just 30 seconds when Lukaku unleashed an 18-yard strike. James McCarthy struck on 23 minutes, and Lukaku made it 3-0 six minutes later.
The visitors fought back back through two goals from Joshua King, on 59 and 70 minutes, but two further strikes by Lukaku, on 83 and 84 minutes, put Everton three clear again.
Harry Arter got another for AFC Bournemouth before Ross Barkley, for the Toffees, completed the goal fest.
