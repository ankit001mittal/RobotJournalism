Joshua King's goal clinched a 2-1 win for AFC Bournemouth during a frenetic finish at the Vitality Stadium against Burnley.
Eddie Howe’s men were rewarded for a strong start, when Junior Stanislas latched on to Lewis Cook’s angled pass to slot past goalkeeper in the 25th minute.
Burnley were restricted to few chances until striker Sam Vokes headed in Johann Berg Gudmundsson’s cross on 83 minutes.
But two minutes later King collected Ryan Fraser’s cutback, held off his marker, and finished from six yards to give AFC Bournemouth a win.
