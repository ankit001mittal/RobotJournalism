Two goals from Jamie Vardy and Danny Drinkwater's stunning strike gave Leicester City victory over Liverpool.
Leicester scored their first goal when Vardy slotted in from Marc Albrighton's through-ball.
Drinkwater doubled the lead on 39 minutes, firing in from 25 yards, before Vardy added a third after the break, heading in Christian Fuchs' cross.
Liverpool got a goal back through Philippe Coutinho but could not stop Leicester to go on and win the match.
