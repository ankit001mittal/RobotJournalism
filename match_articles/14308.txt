Andros Townsend ran the length of the field to wrap up a valuable 2-0 victory for Crystal Palace over West Bromwich Albion that gave them 3 valuable points.
Wilfried Zaha broke the deadlock after the break, chesting down Yohan Cabayeâ€™s crossfield pass and firing home. Six minutes from time, Townsend won the ball on the edge of his own box and raced upfield before scoring with a deflected strike.
