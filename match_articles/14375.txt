Harry Kane scored four goals to help Tottenham Hotspur cruise past Leicester City.
Son Heung-min cut the ball back for Kane to open the scoring on 25 minutes.
Son added a second after a deft, lofted pass from Dele Alli but Ben Chilwell pulled a goal back for the hosts in the second half. Kane nodded in from close range on 63 minutes while Son made it 4-1 by bending the ball into the bottom corner.
Kane then fired in two late strikes to move on to 26 Premier League goals.
