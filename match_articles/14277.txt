Harry Kane's penalty was enough for Tottenham Hotspur to earn three points in a 1-0 win over Middlesbrough at White Hart Lane.
Tottenham dominated in the Middlesbrough goal being denied a goal early on.
Kane made amends for an earlier miss with his 58th-minute spot-kick. Middlesbrough threatened late on, but couldn't salvage a point.
