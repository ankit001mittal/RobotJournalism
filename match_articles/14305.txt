Fernando Llorente scored in stoppage time as Swansea City came from behind to beat Burnley 3-2. 
Llorente's header opened the scoring after 12 minutes but Andre Gray levelled from the penalty spot after a handball. 
Gray's second of the match put Burnley on course for their away win, until Martin Olsson made it 2-2 after a Gylfi Sigurdsson backheel put him through. Swansea City won it when Llorente headed in Tom Carroll's pinpoint cross.
