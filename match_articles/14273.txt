Hull City boosted their points tally with a 2-0 victory over Liverpool at the KCOM Stadium.
After an early scare, Hull led on the stroke of half-time through Alfred N'Diaye, who poked the ball in after the goalkeeper failed to deal with a header.
In a frenetic second half both sides missed significant chances, but Hull secured the points when, with Liverpool pouring forward, Oumar Niasse powered through on the counter to slide the ball under the goalkeeper.
