Tottenham Hotspur earned a 2-0 victory at White Hart Lane.
Spurs controlled the first half, but they did not let up after the break and Alli atoned for his earlier miss by firing in the opener on 55 minutes.
Within 146 seconds it was 2-0, with Harry Kane scoring from the penalty spot after being tripped.
