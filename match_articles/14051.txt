Georginio Wijnaldum and Emre Can were on target as Liverpool came from behind to beat Burnley 2-1 at Anfield.
Burnley got off to a fine start when Ashley Barnes prodded in Matt Lowton's fine pass with seven minutes gone. Liverpool struggled to find their momentum but were level on the stroke of half-time thanks to Wijnaldum, who converted Divock Origiâ€™s cross for the equaliser. The winner came from Can's low drive from distance on 61 minutes.
