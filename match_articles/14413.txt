Harry Kane scored hat-trick to help Tottenham Hotspur to a 7-1 final-day win at Hull City.
Kane broke the deadlock from distance, converted Kieran Trippier's cross.
Dele Alli's goal, Victor Wanyama's header, Ben Davies's long-range hit and Toby Alderweireld's back-post finish gave Spurs their win.
Sam Clucas's sacred an consolation goal, but it did not affect the result.
