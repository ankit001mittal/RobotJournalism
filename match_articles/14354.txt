Middlesbrough were frustrated by Burnley in their fight with a 0-0 home draw. 
Burnley started brightly and went close through Robbie Brady and George Boyd in search of a first away win of 2016/17. 
Alvaro Negredo came off the bench after 58 minutes and the Boro striker nearly opened the scoring when his overhead kick was well saved by Tom Heaton.
Ben Mee and Sam Vokes missed chances for Burnley, who had Matthew Lowton to thank for the point after he twice cleared off his own line from Stewart Downing and Daniel Ayala.
