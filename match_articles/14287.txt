Manolo Gabbiadini made it 2 goals in a match for Southampton in their 4-0 win over Sunderland at the Stadium of Light.
Gabbiadini deflected in Ryan Bertrand's cross on 30 minutes. The Italian then finished brilliantly to make it 2-0 on the stroke of half-time and Southampton maintained their supremacy after the break. A Jason Denayer own goal and a late Shane Long strike confirmed the three points for Southampton.
