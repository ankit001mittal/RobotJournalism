Chelsea came back with a victory at AFC Bournemouth.
Adam Smith’s own goal, Eden Hazard’s goal and a Marcos Alonso free-kick restored all 3 points. Chelsea led on 17 minutes at Vitality Stadium when Chelsea's off-target shot hit Smith to go in.
Three minutes later it was 2-0 as Hazard raced on to N’Golo Kante's through-ball and rounded Artur Boruc.
Joshua King's deflected shot gave the Cherries hope before half-time.
But Chelsea sealed the points through Alonso's free-kick midway through the second half.
