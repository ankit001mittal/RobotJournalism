A stunning goal from Gylfi Sigurdsson gave Swansea City a draw against Manchester United at Old Trafford.
The Swans had the better of the first half, but Man Utd took the lead through Wayne Rooney's penalty in first-half stoppage time, after Marcus Rashford was fouled in the box. United improved after half-time but Swansea claimed a point when Sigurdsson fired into the top corner with 11 minutes to go.
