Sunderland quietened the party atmosphere at Stamford Bridge when Javier Manquillo fired the ball into the roof of the net for his first Premier League goal on three minutes only for Willian to equalise five minutes later.
Eden Hazard put Chelsea ahead in the second half with a powerful shot into the far corner.
Pedro's close-range header put the Blues 3-1 ahead before Michy Batshuayi added two late goals as Chelsea won in style.
