Christian Benteke’s goal earned Crystal Palace a valuable 2-2 draw with Leicester City at Selhurst Park.
Robert Huth put Leicester ahead after only six minutes, heading in Christian Fuchs’ long throw.
Leicester striker Jamie Vardy then netted a second seven minutes after half-time from a breakaway, but Yohan Cabaye pulled one back for Palace two minutes later.
It was left to Benteke to nod in Andros Townsend's cross at the far post to claim a point for Palace.
