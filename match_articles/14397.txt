Kevin De Bruyne scored one goal and set up two others as Manchester City earned a comprehensive victory over Crystal Palace. Manchester City had a great start when David Silva swept the ball home after only 114 seconds. Palace created a couple of openings, but City doubled their lead four minutes into the second half when Vincent Kompany fired in De Bruyneâ€™s cutback. De Bruyne added a third before Raheem Sterling made it 4-0 from Pablo Zabaleta's nod-back across goal. De Bruyne's free-kick set up Nicolas Otamendi's header to make it 5-0 in stoppage time.
