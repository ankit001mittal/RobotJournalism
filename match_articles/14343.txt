Leicester City claimed a home win over Sunderland.
Second-half goals by Islam Slimani and Jamie Vardy ended Sunderland’s resistance.
After a pulsating first half, the deadlock was finally broken on 69 minutes, Marc Albrighton’s searching cross glanced in by Slimani. And moments after, Vardy scored the goal from another Albrighton centre.
