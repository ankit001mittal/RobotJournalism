Gabriel Jesus scored a stoppage-time winner as Manchester City fought off a Swansea City comeback to claim a 2-1 victory at the Etihad Stadium.
The Brazilian tapped in after his header from David Silva was parried by the goalkeeper into his path.
Jesus, also scored Man City's opener from close range on 11 minutes.
But Man City were punished for not adding to their lead as Gylfi Sigurdsson's low strike from outside the penalty area beat the goalkeeper, before Jesus had the final say.
